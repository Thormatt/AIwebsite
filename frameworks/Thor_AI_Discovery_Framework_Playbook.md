# AI with Thor — Client Discovery & Gap Assessment Playbook

**Purpose**: A repeatable, end‑to‑end method to uncover gaps, prioritize AI opportunities, and produce an executive‑ready roadmap and pilot plan.

## The 8 Maturity Dimensions
We assess each area on a 0–5 scale (0=None, 1=Nascent, 2=Exploring, 3=Emerging, 4=Scaling, 5=Transforming).

1. Strategy & Leadership — vision, sponsorship, funding, success criteria  
2. Data — availability, quality, lineage, security, access  
3. People & Skills — literacy, roles, training, change readiness  
4. Technology — platforms, integration, observability, cost control  
5. Governance — policy, risk, compliance, model governance  
6. Operations — processes, workflows, SLAs, support, LangOps/MLOps  
7. Culture — incentives, experimentation, psychological safety, adoption behaviors  
8. Value Realization — measurement, ROI, benefits tracking, benefits ownership

## Literacy × Maturity Matrix (Quadrants)
- **Hype Zone (low literacy, low maturity)**: clarify goals; avoid tool-chasing; create baseline literacy.  
- **Frustration Zone (high literacy, low maturity)**: pilots not scaling; institute governance/ops; align to business value.  
- **Wasted Opportunity Zone (low literacy, high maturity)**: platform investments underused; build role-specific enablement and use-case playbooks.  
- **Transformation Zone (high literacy, high maturity)**: scale responsibly; embed value realization and cost management.

## Engagement Phases (Start→Finish)

**0. Prep** — desk research, stakeholder map, 1‑page hypothesis.  
**1. Discovery** — surveys + interviews across the 8 dimensions.  
**2. Baseline & Heatmap** — maturity scoring; identify blockers.  
**3. Opportunity Inventory** — collect use cases; estimate value/effort/risk.  
**4. Prioritization & Roadmap** — weighted scoring; 30‑60‑90 plan.  
**5. Pilot Design** — pilot charters with success metrics and guardrails.  
**6. Change & Enablement** — champions, training, policy, comms.  
**7. Scale & Govern** — LangOps/MLOps, cost/observability, model lifecycle.  
**8. Value Realization** — dashboards, ROI tracking, quarterly review.

## Core Deliverables
- Discovery Questionnaire (multi‑sheet)  
- Interview Guides (role specific)  
- Maturity Scorecard + Heatmap  
- Literacy × Maturity Matrix placement & actions  
- Prioritization Matrix & shortlist (3–5 high‑value use cases)  
- Pilot Charter(s) with acceptance criteria  
- AI Policy Starter (acceptable use, data handling, safety)  
- Executive Readout (narrative + next 90‑day plan)

**Usage tip**: Duplicate this toolkit per client. Start with the questionnaire to collect baseline facts before interviews. Then use the scorecard and matrix to align on where they are and what to do next.

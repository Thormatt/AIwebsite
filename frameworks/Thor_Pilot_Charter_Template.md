## Problem Statement
What problem are we solving and for whom? Link to baseline metrics.

## Value Hypothesis
Expected measurable outcome (e.g., time saved, cost avoided, revenue lift, risk reduced).

## Success Metrics & Acceptance Criteria
- Primary KPI (+ target)
- Guardrails (safety, cost per task, latency, accuracy thresholds)
- Definition of done

## Scope
In-scope systems, data, users; what is explicitly out of scope.

## Approach
Data access, model(s), retrieval/RAG, agents, integration, evaluation plan.

## Risks & Mitigations
Security, privacy, bias, hallucination risk, change dependence.

## Timeline & Resources
Phases, owners, dependencies, budget, go/no‑go gates.

## Monitoring & Runbook
Observability, logs, rollback, human‑in‑the‑loop, incident handling.

## Scale Plan
What has to be true to graduate to production? (Tech, ops, policy, training)
